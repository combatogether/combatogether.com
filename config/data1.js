a0001	一、病原学特点	I. Etiological Characteristics	T1
a0002	新型冠状病毒属于β属的冠状病毒，有包膜，颗粒呈圆形或椭圆形，常为多形性，直径60-140nm。	The novel coronaviruses belong  to the β genus. They have envelopes, and the particles are round or oval,  often polymorphic, with diameter being 60 to 140 nm. 	P
a0003	其基因特征与SARS-CoV和MERS-CoV有明显区别。	Their genetic characteristics  are significantly different from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 	P
a0004	目前研究显示与蝙蝠SARS样冠状病毒(bat-SL-CoVZC45）同源性达85%以上。	Current research shows that they  share more than 85% homology with bat SARS-like coronaviruses  (bat-SL-CoVZC45). 	P
a0005	体外分离培养时，新型冠状病毒96个小时左右即可在人呼吸道上皮细胞内发现，而在Vero  E6和Huh-7细胞系中分离培养需约6天。	When isolated and cultured in  vitro, the 2019-nCoV can be found in human respiratory epithelial cells in  about 96 hours, however it takes about 6 days for the virus to be found if  isolated and cultured in Vero E6 and Huh-7 cell lines.	P
a0006	对冠状病毒理化特性的认识多来自对SARS-CoV和MERS-CoV的研究。	Most of the know-how about the  physical and chemical properties of coronavirus comes from the research on  SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 	P
a0007	病毒对紫外线和热敏感，56℃  30分钟、乙醚、75%乙醇、含氯消毒剂、过氧乙酸和氯仿等脂溶剂均可有效灭活病毒，氯已定不能有效灭活病毒。	"The virus is sensitive to  ultraviolet and heat. Exposure to 56°C for 30 minutes and lipid solvents such  as ether, 75% ethanol,
     chlorine-containing disinfectant,  peracetic acid, and chloroform can effectively inactivate the virus.  Chlorhexidine has not been effective in inactivating the virus."	P
a0008	二、流行病学特点	II. Epidemiological  Characteristics	T1
a0009	（一）传染源。	1. Source of infection	T2
a0010	目前所见传染源主要是新型冠状病毒感染的患者。无症状感染者也可能成为传染源。	Now, the patients infected by  the novel coronavirus are the main source of infection; asymptomatic infected  people can also be an infectious source.	P
a0011	（二）传播途径。	2. Route of transmission	T2
a0012	经呼吸道飞沫和密切接触传播是主要的传播途径。在相对封闭的环境中长时间暴露于高浓度气溶胶情况下存在经气溶胶传播的可能。由于在粪便及尿中可分离到新型冠状病毒，应注意类便及尿对环境污染造成气溶胶或接触传播。	Transmission of the virus  happens mainly through respiratory droplets and close contact. There is the  possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment for a  long-time exposure to high concentrations of aerosol. As the novel coronavirus  can be isolated in feces and urine, attention should be paid to feces or  urine contaminated environmental that leads to aerosol or contact  transmission.	P
a0013	（三）易感人群。	3. Susceptible groups	T2
a0014	人群普遍易感。	People are generally  susceptible.	P
a0015	三、病理改变根据	III.Pathologial Changes	T1
a0016	目前有限的尸检和穿刺组织病理观察结果总结如下。	Pathological findings from  limited autopsies and biopsy studies are summarized below:	P

The exudates are  composed of monocytes and macrophages, with plenty of multinucleated  syncytial cells. Type II alveolar epithelial cells are markedly hyperplastic,  some of which are desquamated. Viral inclusions are observed in type II  alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. Alveolar interstitium is marked  with vascular congestion and edema, infiltration of monocytes and  lymphocytes, and vascular hyaline thrombi.
