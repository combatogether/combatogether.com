a0032	四、临床特点	IV. Clinical Characteristics	T1
a0033	（一）临床表现。	1. Clinical manifestations	T2
a0034	基于目前的流行病学调查，潜伏期1-14天，多为3-7天。	Based on the current  epidemiological investigation, the incubation period is one to 14 days,  mostly three to seven days.	P
a0035	以发热、干咳、乏力为主要表现。少数患者伴有鼻塞、流涕、咽痛、肌痛和腹泻等症状。重症患者多在发病一周后出现呼吸困难和/或低氧血症，严重者可快速进展为急性呼吸窘迫综合征、脓毒症休克、难以纠正的代谢性酸中毒和出凝血功能障碍及多器官功能衰竭等。值得注意的是重型、危重型患者病程中可为中低热，甚至无明显发热。	Main manifestations include  fever, fatigue and dry cough. Nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat,  myalgia and diarrhea are found in a few cases. Severe cases mostly developed  dyspnea and/or hypoxemia after one week. In severe cases, patients progress rapidly  to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis that  is difficult to correct, coagulopathy, multiple organ failure and others. It  is worth noting that for severe and critically ill patients, their fever  could be moderate to low, or even barely noticeable.	P
a0036	部分儿童及新生儿病例症状可不典型，表现为呕吐、腹泻等消化道症状或仅表现为精神弱、呼吸急促。	Some children and neonatal cases  may have atypical symptoms, manifested as gastrointestinal symptoms such as  vomiting and diarrhea, or only manifested as low spirits and shortness of  breath.	P
a0037	轻型患者仅表现为低热、轻微乏力等，无肺炎表现。	The patients with mild symptoms  did not develop pneumonia but only low fever and mild fatigue.	P
a0038	从目前收治的病例情况看，多数患者预后良好，少数患者病情危重。老年人和有慢性基础疾病者预后较差。患有新型冠状病毒肺炎的孕产妇临床过程与同龄患者相近。儿童病例症状相对较轻。	From current situations, most  patients have good prognosis and a small number of patients are critically  ill. The prognosis for the elderly and patients with chronic underlying  diseases is poor. The clinical course of pregnant women with NCP is similar to  that of patients of the same age. Symptoms in children are relatively mild.	P
a0039	（二）实验室检查。	2. Laboratory tests	T2
a0040	1.一般检查	1) General findings	T3
a0041	发病早期外周血白细胞总数正常或减少，可见淋巴细胞计数减少，部分患者可出现肝酶、乳酸脱氢酶（LDH）、肌酶和肌红蛋白增高；部分危重者可见肌钙蛋白增高。多数患者C反应蛋白（CRP）和血沉升高，降钙素原正常。严重者D-二聚体升高、外周血淋巴细胞进行性减少。重型、危重型患者常有炎症因子升高。	In the early stages of the  disease, peripheral WBC count is normal or decreased and the lymphocyte count  decreases. Some patients see an increase in liver enzymes, lactate  dehydrogenase (LDH), muscle enzymes and myoglobin. Elevated troponin is seen  in some critically ill patients while most patients have elevated C-reactive  protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and normal procalcitonin. In  severe cases, D-dimer increases and peripheral blood lymphocytes  progressively decrease. Severe and critically ill patients often have  elevated inflammatory factors.	P
a0042	2.病原学及血清学检查	2) Pathogenic and serological  findings	T3
a0043	（1）病原学检查：采用RT-PCR或/和NGS方法在鼻咽拭子、痰和其他下呼吸道分泌物、血液、粪便等标本中可检测出新型冠状病毒核酸。检测下呼吸道标本（痰或气道抽取物）更加准确。标本采集后尽快送检。	(1) Pathogenic findings: Novel  coronavirus nucleic acid can be detected in nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum,  lower respiratory tract secretions, blood, feces and other specimens using  RT-PCR and/or NGS methods. It is more accurate if specimens from lower respiratory  tract (sputum or air tract extraction) are tested. The specimens should be  submitted for testing as soon as possible after collection.	P
a0044	（2）血清学检查：新型冠状病毒特异性IgM抗体多在发病3-5天后开始出现阳性，IgG抗体滴度恢复期较急性期有4倍及以上增高。	(2) Serological findings: NCP  virus specific IgM becomes detectable around 3-5 days after onset; IgG  reaches a titration of at least 4-fold increase during convalescence compared  with the acute phase.	P
a0045	（三）胸部影像学。	3. Chest imaging	T2
a0046	早期呈现多发小斑片影及间质改变，以肺外带明显。进而发展为双肺多发磨玻璃影、浸润影，严重者可出现肺实变，胸腔积液少见。	In the early stage, imaging  shows multiple small patchy shadows and interstitial changes, apparent in the  outer lateral zone of lungs. As the disease progresses, imaging then shows  multiple ground glass opacities and infiltration in both lungs. In severe  cases, pulmonary consolidation may occur while pleural effusion is rare.	P

a0102	（二）新型冠状病毒肺炎主要与流感病毒、腺病毒、呼吸道合胞病毒等其他已知病毒性肺炎及肺炎支原体感染鉴别，尤其是对疑似病例要尽可能采取包括快速抗原检测和多重PCR核酸检测等方法，对常见呼吸道病原体进行检测。	2. NCP is mainly distinguished  from other known viral pneumonia and mycoplasma pneumoniae infections such as  influenza virus, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. Especially for  suspect cases, methods such as rapid antigen detection and multiplex PCR  nucleic acid detection should be adopted as much as possible for detection of  common respiratory pathogens.	P
a0103	（三）还要与非感染性疾病，如血管炎、皮肌炎和机化性肺炎等鉴别。	3. It should also be  distinguished from non-infectious diseases such as vasculitis,  dermatomyositis and organizing pneumonia.	P
a0104	九、病例的发现与报告	IX. Case Finding and Reporting	T1
a0105	各级各类医疗机构的医务人员发现符合病例定义的疑似病例后，应当立即进行单人间隔离治疗，院内专家会诊或主诊医师会诊，仍考虑疑似病例，在2小时内进行网络直报，并采集标本进行新型冠状病毒核酸检测，同时在确保转运安全前提下立即将疑似病例转运至定点医院。与新型冠状病毒感染者有密切接触的患者，即便常见呼吸道病原检测阳性，也建议及时进行新型冠状病毒病原学检测。	Health professionals in medical  institutions of all types and at all levels, upon discovering suspect cases  that meet the definition, should immediately put them in single room for  isolation and treatment. If the cases are still considered as suspected after  consultation made by hospital experts or attending physicians, it should be  reported directly online within 2 hours; samples should be collected for new  coronavirus nucleic acid testing and suspect cases should be safely  transferred to the designated hospitals immediately. People who have been in  close contact with patients who have been confirmed of new coronavirus  infection are advised to perform new coronavirus pathogenic testing in a  timely manner, even though common respiratory pathogens are tested positive.	P
a0106	疑似病例连续两次新型冠状病毒核酸检测阴性（采样时间至少间隔24小时）且发病7天后新型冠状病毒特异性抗体IgM和IgG仍为阴性可排除疑似病例诊断。	If two nucleic acid tests, taken  at least 24-hour apart, of a NCP suspect case are negative, and the NCP virus  specific IgM and IgG are negative after 7 days from onset, the suspect  diagnosis can be ruled out.	P
